# IK example

This is a small example on how to use the IK for whole-body motions. To get it
running, you will need to copy the robot model
[JVRC-1.dae](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephane-caron/jvrc_models/openrave/JVRC-1/JVRC-1.dae)
from [jvrc_models](https://github.com/stephane-caron/jvrc_models/tree/openrave)
into this folder. Then, run ``./generate_motion.py``.
